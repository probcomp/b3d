    ### CORE TASK INTERFACE ###
    ### Task developers should define the following. ###

    def get_task_specification() -> "Tuple[Any, Any]":
        """
        Outputs `task_spec`, the input given to a task solver.

    def score(self, solution) -> "Any":
        """
        Scores an attempted solution ot the task, returning a collection of metrics.

        Args:
            - `solution: Any`.  The output of the solver, which is to be scored.

        Returns:
            - `metrics: Any`.  A python dictionary (which can be JSONified) containing
                a collection of metrics measuring how well the given `solution` solves the task.

        Takes the output of `score` and makes assertions about the scores,

        to the task which is acceptable.

            - `scores: Any`.  The output of `Task.score`.
            - `*args, **kwargs`.  Optional arguments which can be used to change the testing behavior.

        This function, if implemented, should run when `task.assert_testing(tester, scores)` is called.
        It may also accept optional *args and **kwargs to change the testing behavior.

        There, one may want to run tests with different tolerances,
        so warnings are not thrown by continuous integration on solvers known to fail the task
        according to the default tolerances).

    ### Optional Viz Methods ###
